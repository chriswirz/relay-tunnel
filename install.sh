# Install relay-tunnel on Linux from the GitHub releases of chriswirz/relay-tunnel.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chriswirz/relay-tunnel/main/install.sh | sh
#
# The script downloads the release binary for this machine's architecture,
# checks it against the published SHA256SUMS, and installs it as `relay-tunnel`.
#
# It installs system-wide into /usr/local/bin, mode 0755, so that `relay-tunnel`
# works both for your own account and under root or sudo - which matters because
# the rendezvous server is usually run by root (or by a systemd unit) while
# `expose` and `connect` are run as yourself. Only when it cannot write there
# (no sudo, or RELAY_TUNNEL_NO_SUDO=1) does it fall back to ~/.local/bin, which
# is reachable by your user alone; the script says so when that happens.
#
# Environment:
#   RELAY_TUNNEL_VERSION      release tag to install (default: the latest release)
#   RELAY_TUNNEL_INSTALL_DIR  where to put the binary (default: as described above)
#   RELAY_TUNNEL_NO_SUDO=1    never escalate; fall back to a user-local install
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: this has to run on whatever shell the machine has.
